#Definition and Usage
The find() method returns the value of the first element in an array that pass a test (provided as a function).

The find() method executes the function once for each element present in the array:

If it finds an array element where the function returns a true value, find() returns the value of that array element (and does not check the remaining values)
Otherwise it returns undefined
